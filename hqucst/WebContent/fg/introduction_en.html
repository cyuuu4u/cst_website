            <p class="college-introdution_en">
                In 1994, the College of Computer Science and Technology was authorized to give master’s degree to students
                in the aspect of Applied Computer Technology. In the same year, it was identified as a key Project by Overseas
                Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council.
                <br><br>
                The College of Computer Science and Technology has 4 undergraduate degree projects, which are: Computer Science,
                Software Engineering, Network Engineering and Multimedia Technology. It need to be pointed out, that since 2014,
                the college began to maintain 2 special English teaching majors, which are Computer Science and Software Engineering.
                Lectures in both majors are taught in English. The college also provides two First-Class Postgraduate Degree Projects,
                which are Computer Science Major and Software Engineering Major, one Second-Class Postgraduate Degree Project,
                which is Pattern Recognition and AI System, and one Master of Engineering Project in the aspect of Computer Technology.
                Among all those Postgraduate projects, Computer Science and Software Engineering are two Key discipline Projects,
                which are identified by Fujian Province.
                <br><br>
                Developing for over 35 years, the college of Computer Science and technology forms four stable academic direction,
                which are Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Intelligent Data Management and Application, Software Engineering and
                Computer Integrated Manufacturing System, and Network and Multimedia Technology.
                <br><br>
                The College has 93 teaching staffs. 76 of them are full time teachers. 11 out of 72, are professors.
